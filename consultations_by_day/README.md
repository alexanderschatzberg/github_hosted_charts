# Consultations By Day For Hospitals

## General Idea

It's possible that ER locations are opperating during hours in which they are not profitable simply because it is the status quo. This exploration aims to quantify the average number of cases seen (recorded as consultatios) during each hour of the day, across different days of the week. The average number of consultations/hour is calculated by taking the total number of
consultations that occurred in an hour since a certain date and dividing that number by the
number of days in that interval.

## Structure

- #### Charts_By_Day

  - A folder that contains a folder for each hospital.
  - The hospital folders contain graphs for each day of the average number of consulations for a given hour during that day.

- #### Consults_Hour PDF
  - Contains charts for the same hospitals, but doesn't take the day into account.
